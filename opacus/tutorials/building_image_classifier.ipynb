    "1. Generally speaking, differentially private training is enough of a regularizer by itself. Adding any more regularization (such as dropouts or data augmentation) is unnecessary and typically hurts performance.\n",
    "2. Tuning MAX_GRAD_NORM is very important. Start with a low noise multiplier like .1, this should give comparable performance to a non-private model. Then do a grid search for the optimal MAX_GRAD_NORM value. The grid can be in the range [.1, 10].\n",
    "3. You can play around with the level of privacy, EPSILON.  Smaller EPSILON means more privacy, more noise -- and hence lower accuracy.  Reducing EPSILON to 5.0 reduces the Top 1 Accuracy to around 53%.  One useful technique is to pre-train a model on public (non-private) data, before completing the training on the private training data.  See the workbook at [bit.ly/opacus-dev-day](https://bit.ly/opacus-dev-day) for an example.\n"
