        in https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.10138 and https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.05307.
        The attack for Opacus first appeared in https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.05307.
        The implemented fix is based on https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.10138 and is
        achieved through calling the Gaussian noise function 2*n times, when n=2
        (see section 5.1 in https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.10138).

        Reason for choosing n=2: n can be any number > 1. The bigger, the more
        computation needs to be done (`2n` Gaussian samples will be generated).
        The reason we chose `n=2` is that, `n=1` could be easy to break and `n>2`
        is not really necessary. The complexity of the attack is `2^p(2n-1)`.
        In PyTorch, `p=53` and so complexity is `2^53(2n-1)`. With `n=1`, we get
        `2^53` (easy to break) but with `n=2`, we get `2^159`, which is hard
        enough for an attacker to break.

    ``torch.optim.Optimizer`` wrapper that adds additional functionality to clip per

    Can be used with any ``torch.optim.Optimizer`` subclass as an underlying optimizer.
    ``DPOptimzer`` assumes that parameters over which it performs optimization belong
    to GradSampleModule and therefore have the ``grad_sample`` attribute.

    On a high level ``DPOptimizer``'s step looks like this:
    1) Aggregate ``p.grad_sample`` over all parameters to calculate per sample norms
    2) Clip ``p.grad_sample`` so that per sample norm is not above threshold
    3) Aggregate clipped per sample gradients into ``p.grad``

    max grad norm limit (``std = noise_multiplier * max_grad_norm``).
    5) Call underlying optimizer to perform optimization step
