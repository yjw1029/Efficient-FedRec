class RenameParamsMixin:
    """
    This class defines an nn.Module whose parameters are renamed. This is useful when you want to
    reimplement a layer but make sure its state_dict and list of parameters are exactly the same
    as another reference layer so that you can have a drop-in replacement that does not depend on
    how your layer is actually implemented. In Opacus, this is used for DPLSTM, where our
    implementation leverages submodules and requires alignment to the state_dict of nn.LSTM.

    Example:

        >>> class DPModel(RenameParamsMixin, nn.Module):
        ...    def __init__(self, hidden_size):
        ...        super().__init__()
        ...        self.w = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(hidden_size, requires_grad=True))
        ...        self.set_rename_map({"w": "weights"})
        ...
        >>> model = DPModel(5)
        >>> model.state_dict()
        {'weights': tensor([0., 0., 0., 0., 0.])}
